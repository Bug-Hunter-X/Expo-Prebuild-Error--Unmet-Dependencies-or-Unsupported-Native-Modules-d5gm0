# Expo Prebuild Error: Unmet Dependencies or Unsupported Native Modules

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using Expo's `expo prebuild` command. The error arises from a mismatch between the project's dependencies and the limitations of the Expo Go app environment.

## Problem

Attempting to use `expo prebuild` results in an error indicating unmet dependencies or unsupported native modules.  This usually means the project relies on features or libraries not available in Expo Go's runtime.

## Solution

The primary solutions involve either:

1. **Removing or Replacing Incompatible Dependencies:** Identify dependencies causing the conflict.  Consider replacing them with Expo-compatible alternatives or removing them if their functionality is non-essential.
2. **Ejecting from Expo:**  If the project's native module requirements are significant and cannot be easily resolved, consider ejecting from the Expo managed workflow. This gives you full control but increases the project's complexity.

This repository provides example code illustrating the error and its resolution.
