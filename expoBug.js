This error typically occurs when using Expo's `expo prebuild` command and involves a mismatch between the project's dependencies and the Expo Go app's capabilities.  It might manifest as an error during the prebuild process, indicating that a required native module or dependency isn't compatible with the Expo Go environment.  The exact error message can vary, but it often involves terms like 'not supported' or 'unmet dependencies'.
