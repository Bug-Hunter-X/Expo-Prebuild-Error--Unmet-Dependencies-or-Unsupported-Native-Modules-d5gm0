The solution depends on the specific dependencies causing the issue.  Here's a general approach:

1. **Identify the problematic dependency:** Examine the error message carefully.  It usually points to the specific package causing the incompatibility.
2. **Check for Expo-compatible alternatives:**  Search for Expo-compatible versions or substitutes for the problematic dependency.  Many popular libraries have Expo-friendly versions.
3. **Remove or simplify the dependency (if possible):** If a direct alternative doesn't exist and the dependency's functionality is not critical, consider removing it or simplifying its usage.  
4. **Eject from Expo (as a last resort):** If the project relies heavily on native modules incompatible with Expo Go, consider ejecting to fully control the native Android and iOS projects.  This, however, increases maintenance overhead.

**Example (Illustrative):**

Let's say the error points to a dependency on `react-native-sensitive-info`.  This module might not be fully compatible with Expo Go.

**Option 1 (Preferred): Find an alternative**

Search for an Expo-compatible alternative for storing sensitive information.

**Option 2 (If no alternative): Remove or simplify**

If the need for sensitive-info storage is non-essential for the initial development stage, remove it.  Implement it later in a production-ready environment after ejection.

**Option 3 (Last resort): Eject**

If the requirement is strong, follow Expo's documentation for ejecting from the managed workflow to work directly with the native iOS and Android projects.
